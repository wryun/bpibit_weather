BPI Bit (bpi:bit) Weather Info for MicroPython

WIP. Still need to figure out how to do deepsleep and make caching better.

Some of the display code was based on:

https://github.com/BPI-STEAM/MicroPython-Samples

(hence licence file)

ucontextlib.py is from:

https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/ucontextlib/ucontextlib.py
